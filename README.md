# Audiophile E-Commerce website

I have built the marketing site for a audiophile online-shop.
The website is responsive, you can use it on your phone, tablet or normal desktop.

## TechStack

- React
- Typescript
- React-Router
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Add/remove items to/from the cart
- Change quantity of items
- Fill the client form
